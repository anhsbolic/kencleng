# Kencleng — Development Tracker

> Status: Living project status
> Last reconciled: 2026-09-26
> Current Kencleng authoritative Product Authority baseline: `main@e32916b597412094976e3e6263095e861ec18391` (`Promote Product Authority and MVP delivery model (#27)`)
> Harscode operational baseline: `main@b64fa11082a094d0e1b6e9488c20eac1c7f9777b`
> Purpose: Keep cross-domain and product-slice delivery state visible without turning dated progress into workflow policy.

## 1. What this tracker owns

This file owns current project delivery state across product slices, domains, and cross-cutting frontend/backend work.

It does not replace:

- `docs/product/` for Product Authority, MVP scope, or MVP sequencing;
- `docs/spec/<domain-dir>/tasks.md` for domain-local task views;
- reconciled feature specs for detailed acceptance criteria;
- UI/UX authorities for design truth;
- `docs/project/kencleng-integration-map.md` for cross-stack structural dependency mapping;
- Harscode artifacts for one development run;
- `docs/kencleng-agentic-workflow.md` for project orchestration policy.

When status cannot be proven confidently, use `NEEDS_RECONCILIATION` instead of guessing.

## 2. Status vocabulary

Ordinary progress:

```text
NOT_STARTED
IN_PROGRESS
BLOCKED
NEEDS_RECONCILIATION
READY_TO_START
```

Evidence-backed milestones:

```text
CONTRACT_READY
BACKEND_VERIFIED
FRONTEND_MOCK_VERIFIED
INTEGRATED_VERIFIED
SLICE_FINALIZED
DELIVERED
```

Historical rows may use `DOMAIN_FINALIZED`; new MVP delivery should prefer the real product unit (`SLICE_FINALIZED`) where applicable.

Code existing in history is not sufficient evidence for a verified milestone.

## 3. Product Authority / MVP status

| Concern | Status | Evidence / notes |
|---|---|---|
| Whole-product Product Authority | `ACTIVE / AUTHORITATIVE` | `docs/product/product-overview.md`; promoted to `main` by PR #27 at `e32916b597412094976e3e6263095e861ec18391`. |
| Product Design / Brand Authority | `READY` | Canonical `docs/ui-ux/`; Sunlit Editorial / Evidence-Led Optimism approved. |
| MVP release scope | `APPROVED` | `docs/product/mvp-scope.md`; human approval 2026-09-17. |
| MVP delivery sequencing | `APPROVED` | `docs/product/mvp-delivery-slices.md`; human approval 2026-09-17. |
| Product Authority routing | `ACTIVE / AUTHORITATIVE` | Root/scoped AGENTS, product/spec routing, and orchestration were promoted with PR #27. |
| Probe 01 — Public Campaign Detail | `PASS` | Forward derivation + public lifecycle decision + narrow contract reconciliation recorded. |
| Probe 02 — Account Registration + Email Verification | `PAUSED_REFRAMED` | Useful salvage evidence; Account is outside baseline MVP critical path. |

Approved MVP loop:

```text
Slice 1 — Public Campaign Understanding
→ Slice 2 — Guest Donation + Truthful Donation State
→ Slice 3 — Campaign Closure + Persistent Public Result
→ Slice 4 — Accountability Follow-up
```

## 4. Current domain snapshot

Domain rows remain useful for semantic/implementation evidence, but they do **not** define current MVP delivery order.

| Domain | Delivery/spec state | Backend | Frontend | Current notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Account | `NEEDS_RECONCILIATION` when next needed | Historical implementation exists | `NOT_STARTED` for new generation | Outside baseline MVP critical path. Preserve security/correctness evidence; do not resume historical roadmap by inertia. |
| Notification | Historical/draft reference | `NOT_STARTED` as standalone delivery | `NOT_STARTED` | Include only when a real slice requires active notification behavior. |
| Organization | Historical/draft reference | `NOT_STARTED` | `NOT_STARTED` | Slice 1 needs only minimum persisted/public-safe steward context; full self-service is deferred. |
| Campaign | `SLICE_FINALIZED` for Slice 1 | `BACKEND_VERIFIED` | `FRONTEND_MOCK_VERIFIED` | Contract, backend, frontend mock-parallel experience, topology/private media, and real cross-stack integration are verified; Human finalization approved for Slice 1. |
| Donation | Slice-2 Techplan `WAITING_HUMAN`; historical/draft artifacts remain reference evidence | `NOT_STARTED` active generation | `NOT_STARTED` | `WU-S2-001` Exploration and `WU-S2-002` Techplan Synthesis are complete; Techplan awaits Human gate. No Slice-2 contract or delivery milestone is earned. Correctness-critical money areas retain Tier-0 fencing. |
| Disbursement | Historical/draft reference | `NOT_STARTED` | `NOT_STARTED` | Not baseline MVP critical path; do not pull in merely to make accountability look complete. |

## 5. Historical Account/backend evidence

Historical Account backend work remains useful and is not erased by the Product Authority reframe.

Known historical commits include:

| Scope | Historical main evidence |
|---|---|
| Account backend task 01 | `14834e5` — register/email verification |
| Account backend task 02 | `efc1111` → `ce61841` — Google OAuth sequence |
| Account backend task 03 + old frontend tasks 01–02 | `16a4bf9` |
| Account backend task 04 + old frontend tasks 03–04 | `ea7d5bc` |
| Account backend/frontend task 05 | `6f036c6` |
| Account backend/frontend task 06 | `50b9a18` |
| Account backend task 07 | `6a846bd` |
| Account backend task 08 | `0798c5d` — exploration only at the older checkpoint |

These entries prove historical work happened. They do not automatically prove current product relevance/completion. Probe 02 records the current salvage/reframe posture.

## 6. UI/UX and frontend readiness

The upstream Product Brand + UI Design Exploration is complete and human-approved.

Active authority includes:

- `docs/ui-ux/README.md` — routing map;
- `docs/ui-ux/brand-product-ui-brief.md` — Sunlit Editorial / Evidence-Led Optimism;
- `docs/ui-ux/product-design-principles.md` — design judgment/readiness/autonomy boundary;
- `docs/ui-ux/design-guidelines.md` — concrete visual system;
- `docs/ui-ux/patterns.md` — recurring interaction behavior;
- `docs/ui-ux/asset-governance.md` — asset lifecycle/truthfulness;
- `docs/ui-ux/page-map.md` — persona/surface intent;
- `docs/ui-ux/visual-references/selected-direction/` — approved direction evidence.

Removed legacy design/prototype generations are Git history only.

Frontend reboot:

```text
COMPLETE
```

Frontend Experience Foundation Task 01:

```text
DELIVERED
```

Evidence:

- PR #24 / `71093b687cd7135495bc6ed62d520a621f96f586` implemented the representative `/` calibration surface and received human rendered acceptance PASS;
- PR #25 / `fca5a8f3178b53e5eec006064d8bcf2b078771b3` closed Validation 02;
- PR #26 / `15a3e02cc88d00e8dee70f8dfb07c36cb1e2fe5a` aligned frontend autonomy and contract-parallel delivery.

Cross-cutting frontend readiness remains sufficient for real vertical product work.

## 7. Current development selection

Active product outcome is now:

```text
Slice 2 — Guest Donation + Truthful Donation State
```

Slice 1 remains finalized:

```text
SLICE_FINALIZED
```

Slice-2 orchestration evidence:

- `WU-S2-001 / EXP-S2-001-001` completed Stage 2 gap analysis and Stage 3 solutioning; the Stage 3 Human gate is recorded in its artifact provenance.
- `WU-S2-002` — Donation Domain & Contract Reconciliation — is `WAITING_HUMAN`; Techplan `TP-S2-002-001` is Draft/In-Review after completing synthesis.
- Human must choose whether to run the recommended independent review or proceed to direct review. Planner-owned `report-techplan.md` is pending until the applicable review/resolution route converges; the premature Orchestrator-authored digest was withdrawn. Material Open Items remain unresolved; no contract or implementation milestone has been earned.
- Backend/frontend delivery Work Units remain underived until the shared Slice-2 contract is reconciled.

Slice-1 completion evidence:

- `WU-S1-001 / EXP-001` established current authority and delivery gaps;
- `WU-S1-002 / TP-001` reconciled the public Campaign contract and was Human-approved;
- independent planning review/resolution closed the public closed-object gap;
- Build/Code Review/targeted patch cycles closed the TypeScript verification and controlled-media URL findings;
- `TST-001` independently verified R1–R13 at the artifact/contract/generated-contract boundary;
- Human Authority accepted `CONTRACT_READY` on 2026-09-22.

Current boundary:

```text
CONTRACT_READY
✓ reconciled

BACKEND_VERIFIED
✓ earned

FRONTEND_MOCK_VERIFIED
✓ earned

TOPOLOGY_VERIFIED
✓ earned

INTEGRATED_VERIFIED
✓ earned

SLICE_FINALIZED
✓ Human-approved
```

Slice 1 has completed technical, integrated, and Human finalization. Slice 2 is in progress: Exploration is complete and contract reconciliation is queued; implementation has not started.

## 8. Continuous Real-Task Validation posture

Harscode authority:

```text
main@b64fa11082a094d0e1b6e9488c20eac1c7f9777b
Operational Default / Level 2
```

The historical `workflow-v2` branch is experimental lineage, not authority for new Kencleng work.

CRTV resumes through ordinary MVP development after Product Authority promotion is merged.

Critical CRTV rule:

> Use the canonical Harscode Exploration kickoff with normal variables/context. Do not add a custom task-specific solution-steering prompt that tells the agent which authorities, gaps, or conclusions it should discover.

If an agent cannot discover information that the repository should make derivable, record that as validation evidence rather than rescuing the run with hidden conclusions.

Session-level telemetry should preserve both efficiency and correctness evidence.

## 9. Current delivery gate

The Product Authority promotion gate is closed. PR #27 is historical promotion evidence, not an active blocker.

Current gate:

```text
Slice 2 Exploration complete
→ reconcile Donation domain detail and shared contract (`WU-S2-002`)
→ earn Slice-2 CONTRACT_READY
→ derive backend/frontend Work Units from the reconciled contract
→ earn their applicable independent verification milestones
→ integrate against the same contract
→ complete Slice-2 Human/product acceptance before SLICE_FINALIZED
```

Open amount/payment/timing, guest-data/status access, `401`/`404`, and `max_amount`/eligibility questions remain unresolved in the Exploration handoff. Route them to owning authorities when the reconciliation plan needs a decision; do not promote historical draft values silently. Do not infer runtime completion from contract readiness.

## 10. Update discipline

Update this file when project-level state materially changes.

For each update:

- point to concrete evidence when available;
- distinguish operator-reported verification from checks actually executed by an agent/tool;
- avoid copying detailed acceptance criteria from feature specs;
- avoid copying Harscode phase reports;
- keep blockers/provisional dependencies visible;
- do not mark work complete because implementation merely exists;
- keep structural cross-stack mappings in `kencleng-integration-map.md` instead of duplicating them here;
- when historical status cannot be proven, use `NEEDS_RECONCILIATION`.
