You are deciding whether an Approved Techplan should be decomposed into
execution task files.

Read:
- /home/anhar-solehudin/kencleng-workspace/kencleng/frontend/.local-agents/works/00-foundations/01-frontend-experience-foundation/2-techplan/techplan.md in full;
- /home/anhar-solehudin/kencleng-workspace/harscode-workspace/workflow/2-techplan/rules.md §10 (Techplan spine
  and decomposition invariant);
- the decomposition rules and splitting-axis guidance in this prompt.

Response style: be concise about the decomposition decision, but preserve full
execution detail inside any generated task file. This step redistributes scope;
it does not compress away required information.

STEP 0 — GATE (answer explicitly before generating anything)
Is decomposition genuinely useful for this Techplan?

Answer NO and stop when:
- the work is linear/cohesive enough to execute as one unit;
- the proposed split would create trivial boundaries with no context/review
  benefit;
- the only reason to split is document length.

Answer YES only when at least one real execution/review/context boundary exists.
State the signal(s) that justify the split.

STEP 1 — CHOOSE THE SPLITTING AXIS
Choose the least-surprising axis that reflects the actual work. Do not choose
an axis merely because it is available:

- Dependency / sequence — use when task B genuinely cannot execute until task A
  establishes a prerequisite contract/data/schema/component.
- Component / module — use when separate modules can be changed/reviewed with
  little implementation-context overlap and no hard dependency.
- Vertical layer — use when persistence/business/interface layers form useful
  independent execution/review steps; do not use if separating layers would
  hide a cross-layer invariant.
- Independently reviewable chunk — use when a coherent behavior slice can be
  implemented/reviewed on its own without inventing a new contract boundary.
- Risk / blast radius — use when sensitive/security/data-destructive/breaking
  work should be isolated from lower-risk work for review/authority reasons.

When more than one axis could work, prefer the one that makes dependencies and
contract ownership easiest for Build to understand. State the chosen axis and
why before generating task files.

STEP 2 — GENERATE TASK FILES
Write task files under /home/anhar-solehudin/kencleng-workspace/kencleng/frontend/.local-agents/works/00-foundations/01-frontend-experience-foundation/2-techplan/tasks/.

Each task file must include:
- compact provenance using only known/exposed values: Phase, Author, Created/
  Updated, and where safe/available Model, Reasoning, Session, target revision,
  and workflow revision;
- task purpose and exact scoped outcome;
- parent Techplan path/version/status back-reference;
- parent rule/decision/risk/contract IDs that govern the task;
- scoped implementation detail and code anchors needed for this task;
- hard dependency task(s), only when genuinely required;
- scoped verification obligations the task must satisfy before handoff;
- any explicit NOT-in-this-task boundary needed to prevent scope bleed.

Do not invent missing provenance metadata or persist account/credential
identifiers. Git history is the default version history.

A task must be executable from:

parent Techplan spine
+ this task file
+ declared hard-dependency task only when required
+ current live code/spec authority

It must not require unrelated sibling task files merely because they exist.

STEP 3 — PRESERVE THE SPINE
Do NOT move or rewrite material information so it exists only in a child task.
The parent Techplan remains authoritative for:
- material scope/rules;
- chosen/rejected decisions and rationale;
- risks/accepted exposure;
- interface/data/authority contracts;
- verification obligations;
- unresolved Open Items.

Child tasks may reference those IDs and add scoped execution detail. If the
split exposes a material decision/risk/contract/verification item missing from
the parent spine, STOP: the Techplan needs revision/human gate (and possibly
re-review), not a hidden child-task fix.

Do not reinterpret an approved decision while decomposing. Do not generate or
regenerate the human-facing report here; `report-techplan.md` is independent
of whether decomposition runs.

STEP 4 — GENERATE THE MANIFEST LAST
Write a manifest under /home/anhar-solehudin/kencleng-workspace/kencleng/frontend/.local-agents/works/00-foundations/01-frontend-experience-foundation/2-techplan/tasks/ containing:
- compact provenance under the same rule as task files;
- task file list + short purpose;
- chosen splitting axis + rationale;
- dependency graph/order, or explicit `no hard dependency` where appropriate;
- parent Techplan back-reference;
- any shared contract/risk IDs that multiple tasks must coordinate around.

The manifest is an execution map at generation time, not a progress ledger.
Do not add done/in-progress status tracking. Model/client routing also does not
belong here unless an active target/harness execution profile explicitly owns
and requests that metadata.

At completion, report:

## Phase handoff
- Completed: decomposition gate + generated task set/manifest when warranted
- Artifacts: <task/manifest paths or "none">
- Human decision: <review/accept the split when files were generated; "none" when decomposition was skipped>
- Open / deferred: <contract gap discovered or "none">
- Recommended next step: human check of the split when generated, then Build; otherwise Build after Approved Techplan
- Session transition: <plain-language action + reason; Build is fresh-preferred>
- Context pointers: parent Techplan + first/current task + declared hard dependency only
